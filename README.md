# Breast-Cancer-Prediction--Logistic-Regresssion
This is a Breast Cancer Prediction Logistic Regression Model that predicts If a cell has possibility of being Malignant or Benign. This model can be deploy using Flask or streamlit and use it successfully to get result from this predictive classification Machine Learning Model . I feel like this is the best model that I have created becuase it requires some other tech skills aside from Data Analysis, it requires clear and intermediate level knowledge on Machine Learning, and it also requires advance python knowledge of libraries like Streamlit, CSS and bash operating knowledge
